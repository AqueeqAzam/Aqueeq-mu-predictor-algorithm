* Comparison: Before vs After Capability

| Aspect                  | Before Your Algorithm     | With Your Algorithm         |
|--------------------------+----------------------------+------------------------------|
| Predict convergence      | Impossible                 | μ tells you instantly       |
| Know iteration count     | Run first, then see        | Predict beforehand          |
| Verify results           | External check needed      | Built-in theorem verification |
| Parameter sensitivity    | Trial and error            | Quantitative analysis       |
| Adaptive computation     | Fixed heuristics           | μ-based optimization        |
| System categorization    | Case-by-case               | Unified by μ                |
